## Goals:
- You're looking at Docker but need to tie it together with a bunch of existing tools
- You're looking to increase your velocity by implementing continuous delivery & testing
- You need to gather and surface critical stats for your applications
- You want to make sure you're auditing for security at the earliest possible stage
- You don't want to marry yourself to a particular cloud provider like EC2 or OpenStack

## Category:

Management & Operations
## Concepts shown:

- CI/ CD
- Deployment
- Cloud independence (EC2 or OpenStack as the underlying hosts that have the docker engine)
- Stats
